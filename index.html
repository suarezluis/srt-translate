2 00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,536 Market Equities will sue the state. 3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,335 This state's gonna go bankrupt. 4 00:00:17,359 -->
00:00:20,468 Sounds like an impeachable offense to me. 5 00:00:20,492 -->
00:00:22,035 I know how you feel. 6 00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,001 So when I say
that I am sorry, Monica, 7 00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,059 I really mean it. 8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,901 The Department of Interior has approved two
pipelines 9 00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:32,235 through the reservation. 10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,335 If there's nothing you can do and there's nothing
I can do 11 00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,502 why are you telling me? 12
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:37,601 Because I know who's coming after your office 13
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,168 and they'll use this against you. 14 00:00:39,192
--> 00:00:42,135 If the state kills the herd, will they pay you back? 15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,701 I don't know how we rebuild a hundred years of
genetics. 16 00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,302 Need to move our herd down south. 17
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:47,601 Beth: How much is that going to cost? 18
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,802 1.4 a month. 19 00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:50,936 I'll
go with the herd. 20 00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,067 You four are coming with me.
21 00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:53,235 Where? 22 00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,060
Somewhere where is doesn't snow in the winter. 23 00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,369
Young Rip: He's dead? 24 00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:58,802 Why didn't you just tell
me he fell off his horse? 25 00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,869 You said never to lie
to you, so... I didn't. 26 00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:03,058 There's a thing I could
do 27 00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,369 but if I do it, you don't ever leave this
place. 28 00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:06,435 You'll be part of this ranch 29
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,859 until the day you die. 30 00:01:17,159 -->
00:01:18,192 Lloyd: All right, ready? 31 00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,058 What did
he say? 32 00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,159 About my daughter. 33 00:02:22,159 -->
00:02:23,893 What did he say? 34 00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:28,536 Um... 35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,193 You killed him over it. It must have been pretty
bad. 36 00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,626 He... He talked about her... 37
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:39,460 - He... - Something sexual? 38 00:02:41,825 -->
00:02:43,769 Yes sir. 39 00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,259 Something s-sexual. 40
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:51,360 Why did it bother you? 41 00:02:53,526 -->
00:02:55,159 You're not my daughter. 42 00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,001 Yeah, you
should be shaking your head. 43 00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,135 He was a good hand
44 00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,869 and now he's gone because he insulted you. 45
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:03,769 But he didn't insult you, 46 00:03:03,793 -->
00:03:05,967 he insulted my daughter, which insulted you. 47 00:03:05,991 -->
00:03:08,235 Which leads me to my next question... 48 00:03:08,259 -->
00:03:10,492 Is something going on between you and my daughter? 49 00:03:15,225
--> 00:03:17,536 Hmm, yeah. 50 00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,425 That sure makes
things a lot clearer. 51 00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,536 The only time you fight
working for me is to protect 52 00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,436 somebody on this
ranch, 53 00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,025 or the ranch itself. 54 00:03:31,693 -->
00:03:35,135 And you will be surprised how much fighting you'll have to do. 55
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,159 It surprises the hell out of me. 56 00:03:46,659
--> 00:03:51,201 A long time ago, cowboys would drift in 57 00:03:51,225 -->
00:03:55,025 and get work on some outfit, then disappear. 58 00:03:56,393 -->
00:03:58,135 A few months later, a whole chunk 59 00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,058
of the herd would disappear. 60 00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,225 It was the cowboys
who started it. 61 00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,058 You find out real fast who's
willing to ride 62 00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,293 for the brand when they learn
they gotta wear it. 63 00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:15,526 Our cattle stopped getting
stolen after that. 64 00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,369 What that means today is...
65 00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,000 You are committing yourself to this ranch 66
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:26,168 for the rest of life. 67 00:04:26,192 -->
00:04:28,425 And this ranch is committing itself to you. 68 00:04:36,159 -->
00:04:39,793 You will have a home till the day you die... 69 00:04:43,192 -->
00:04:44,725 or this ranch is no more. 70 00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:50,135 Hm. 71
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:53,135 Now... 72 00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,159 that is
something worth fighting for. 73 00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:04,725 It's ready. 74
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:12,192 You're not staying? 75 00:05:14,393 -->
00:05:16,858 Nah, this is between you and the cowboys that wear it. 76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,692 Don't worry, I'll know what you choose tomorrow.
77 00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:29,858 Didn't know I had a choice. 78 00:05:30,925 -->
00:05:32,159 You always have a choice. 79 00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,601 What's
the choice? 80 00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,201 Another ride back to Wyoming. 81
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:38,946 But you ain't coming back from the next one. 82

00:07:50,935 Why do cowboys get up at three in the morning 95 00:07:50,959 -->
00:07:52,735 if breakfast is served at six? 96 00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,569

man. 99 00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,269 So cowboys pride themselves on honesty,
100 00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:01,136 but you start every day with a lie. 101
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,435 It's not a lie, it's like a... 102 00:08:03,459

00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,458 every night. 204 00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:05,368 You
know, I think sometimes 205 00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,767 God gives us tragedies
so we can pass along 206 00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:12,135 how we survived it to the
next generation of sufferers, 207 00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,659 if that makes
any sense. 208 00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,601 And maybe someday all that
knowledge leads to 209 00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,325 no tragedies at all. 210
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,700 What a world that would be, huh? 211 00:17:23,724
--> 00:17:26,400 Yeah. What a world indeed. 212 00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:29,700 I
got something to ask Kayce, but we both know 213 00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:31,135
who wears the pants in your deal, 214 00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,267 so, I'm just
gonna cut out the middle man and ask you. 215 00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,900
Okay. 216 00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:38,224 I'm needed in Helena. 217 00:17:39,759
--> 00:17:43,168 I need Rip with the cattle and I have no one to run this place.
218 00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,767 Next to the reservation is what's called East
Camp. 219 00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,334 There's an old house there that needs a
little work, 220 00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,592 but it's yours if you'll take it.
221 00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:54,592 In exchange for what? 222 00:17:57,224 -->
00:17:58,900 The ranch can't be Tate's some day 223 00:17:58,924 -->
00:18:00,192 if the ranch isn't here. 224 00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,424 I need
his help. I need it from all of you. 225 00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:09,924 We can
help. 226 00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:12,491 Thank you. 227 00:18:14,659 -->
00:18:16,592 That's all you ever had to do, you know. 228 00:18:17,924 -->
00:18:19,558 Just ask. 229 00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,592 Well, now I know. 230
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,558 How many is that? 231 00:18:46,424 -->
00:18:48,135 There's eighteen. 232 00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,135 We'll load up
these four trucks and we'll hit the road 233 00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,735 and
I'll get Lloyd to load up the rest and get 'em down there. 234 00:18:54,759 -->
00:18:57,735 You figure out a crew to help when you get down there? 235
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,868 Travis said he's got one. 236 00:19:00,892 -->
00:19:03,301 I don't need him cowboying on our show horses. 237 00:19:03,325 -->
00:19:05,801 No, no, sir, he won't be doing that now. I promise. 238
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,023 All right. You let me know if you need anything,
239 00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:12,267 Sorry it has to be like this. 240 00:19:12,291
--> 00:19:13,858 Sir, it is what it is. 241 00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:18,192 You
know what they say about cowboying... 242 00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,735 if it
was easy everyone would do it. 243 00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,934 Yeah. 244
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,892 It ain't that. 245 00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,668
Can you come tomorrow and get the rest on the road? 246 00:19:29,692 -->
00:19:31,601 I need to ask my wife. 247 00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,958 Yeah, you
do that, son. 248 00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,801 And whatever she says, you stick
to it. 249 00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,368 Yeah. 250 00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:40,635
Tends to be the safest move. 251 00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,459 You're stronger
than I was. 252 00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:48,892 I guess that's how it's supposed
to be. 253 00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,325 I love you, son. 254 00:20:12,291 -->
00:20:14,267 You'd think he was the one leaving. 255 00:20:14,291 -->
00:20:15,923 He is. 256 00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,159 - Let's go. - Sir. 257
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:27,135 Ladies and Gentlemen of the Legislature 258
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,192 and the Senate... 259 00:21:33,159 -->
00:21:35,368 Thank you for coming. Thanks so much. 260 00:21:35,392 -->
00:21:36,491 Good to see you. 261 00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:41,899 Why so few
council members? 262 00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:44,135 I find it hard to believe
they'd support a pipeline 263 00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,235 through the
reservation. 264 00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:47,368 They won't stand with me. 265
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,259 Angela's got their ear now. 266 00:22:02,790 -->
00:22:05,023 Well, this is getting interesting. 267 00:22:06,159 -->
00:22:09,467 I must admit I'm surprised at the support. 268 00:22:09,491 -->
00:22:10,867 Assuming you're here to give it. 269 00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:13,999
Well, this is how bad I don't want a pipeline on my land. 270 00:22:14,023 -->
00:22:18,135 I can only... can only imagine you feel the same. 271 00:22:18,159
--> 00:22:20,400 You imagine right. 272 00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,334 All right,
so who starts this deal? 273 00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,668 You're the governor.
I'll leave that to you. 274 00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:28,668 Well, it's your land
their talking about wrecking. 275 00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,023 All right. I'll
introduce you. 276 00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:38,700 Jamie: I have called this
emergency meeting 277 00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:44,368 of the Assembly to address
an egregious act of dereliction. 278 00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:45,899 In canceling
funding 279 00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:48,135 for the Paradise Valley International
Airport 280 00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,668 and surrounding residential,
commercial, 281 00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,135 and mixed communities, 282
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,899 Governor Dutton has violated state law 283
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:00,467 and his sworn oath of office 284 00:23:00,491 -->
00:23:04,200 to act in the best interests of the state. 285 00:23:04,224 -->
00:23:07,235 He has exposed the state to litigation, 286 00:23:07,259 -->
00:23:09,267 which I have been informed is forthcoming. 287 00:23:09,291 -->
00:23:14,135 He has robbed the state of billions in tax revenue 288 00:23:14,159
--> 00:23:16,301 and thousands of jobs. 289 00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,966 By
doubling taxes on non-residents 290 00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,699 and initiating
a sales tax on non-residents, 291 00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:25,168
<i>he</i> threatens to extinguish 292 00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:29,891 our state's
single biggest generator of revenue: Tourism. 293 00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,999
These are callous, calculated actions 294 00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:38,334 that are
only in the best interest of the governor himself 295 00:23:38,358 -->
00:23:41,301 and will have devastating consequences 296 00:23:41,325 -->
00:23:44,301 for our constituents, 297 00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:47,224 the people
who elected us. 298 00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,790 The reason we are here. 299
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,934 John: Progress. It's, uh... 300 00:23:54,958 -->
00:23:58,135 seems that's all ever talk about. 301 00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,168
But I never talk about what the word actually means... 302 00:24:00,192 -->
00:24:04,999 it means "to proceed," "to move forward," that's all. 303
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,667 Typically we interpret moving forward as better...
304 00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:10,368 better for us as a people, better for the
planet, 305 00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:13,667 which is usually better for us as a
people. 306 00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:16,435 And if we use it in that manner 307
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,400 I agree. 308 00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,667 But
when something benefits one group over another group 309 00:24:21,691 -->
00:24:23,501 you can't use that word anymore. 310 00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:25,699
You must use another word. You must use "bias," 311 00:24:25,723 -->
00:24:28,800 you must use "favoritism." 312 00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:31,867
Running a pipeline beneath the drinking water 313 00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,501
of an already strained and impoverished community 314 00:24:34,525 -->
00:24:36,899 may be progress for the owners of the pipeline 315 00:24:36,923 -->
00:24:39,600 or owners of whatever runs through the pipeline 316 00:24:39,624
--> 00:24:41,135 or for those receiving it 317 00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,301 but
it could lead to disastrous effects 318 00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:48,267 to the
land and the people this pipeline runs beneath. 319 00:24:48,291 -->
00:24:50,934 Which is not progress at all. 320 00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,501 And
it is for those people, 321 00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,267 and for the future of
Montana... 322 00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,667 And for that reason, as governor of
Montana, 323 00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:01,467 I cannot support that endeavor and
will use the full weight 324 00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,168 of my office to
prevent it from happening. 325 00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,168 That the Attorney
General's office, under Article 5, 326 00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:09,135 and section
13 of the State Constitution, 327 00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,990 is requesting a
Senate Tribunal seeking impeachment. 328 00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,334 I didn't
expect that. 329 00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:20,459 Me neither. 330 00:25:23,790 -->
00:25:25,467 Well thank you, Governor. 331 00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,435 You,
uh, took my whole speech. 332 00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:29,766 That's what I was
going to say. 333 00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,533 The President visited us last
week. 334 00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:39,566 He spoke about improving the quality of
life here. 335 00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,334 He spoke of the schools, our health
clinics, our sovereignty. 336 00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:46,999 Woman: Read this.
337 00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,667 Oh my God. 338 00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:51,135
Governor Dutton, can you respond to the charges? 339 00:25:51,159 -->
00:25:52,435 What are they saying? 340 00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:53,899 Read this,
John. 341 00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:57,600 Governor Dutton, do you have a comment,
sir? 342 00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,533 Have you read that report? 343
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,168 This is why I said he's not fit for this office.
344 00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:06,200 Don't answer any questions just leave. 345
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,667 Man: Governor. 346 00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,633 -
It appears you got ambushed. - Yeah, it looks that way. 347 00:26:11,657 -->
00:26:15,800 If I'd known this was going to happen I wouldn't have come. 348
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,435 So what do you have to say? 349 00:26:19,325 -->
00:26:21,499 Excuse me. 350 00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:23,135 This moment isn't
about me. 351 00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,334 And I won't let it be. 352
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:27,867 The issues facing this reservation are real. 353
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:30,267 Far more real than any theater being played out
354 00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,966 in Helena right now. 355 00:26:31,990 -->
00:26:34,800 Keep your focus on the issue of today because it will still 356
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:36,699 be one tomorrow. Thank you. 357 00:26:51,723 -->
00:26:52,734 Clara: He can't point to a single code 358 00:26:52,758 -->
00:26:54,600 or conduct violation. 359 00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:57,135 He talks
about litigation and damages but no litigation 360 00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,267
has been filed so there's no damages to consider. 361 00:26:59,291 -->
00:27:01,490 His entire impeachment claim is conjecture. 362 00:27:03,159 -->
00:27:06,135 Sometimes conjecture is all you need to get started. 363
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,334 Truth prevails. 364 00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,490
It's not that kind of fight, Clara. 365 00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:14,400 Truth
won't win this one. 366 00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,824 Well if truth won't win
it, I don't know what will. 367 00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:20,691 Menace. 368
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,438 I don't know how to fight with menace. 369
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,923 I'll teach you. 370 00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:00,533
- What are you doing here? - What do you mean? 371 00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,734
My father's gone. Why aren't you with him? 372 00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:04,434 I'm
on house arrest. I can't go with him. 373 00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,633 Well,
you were with him at the county fair last night. 374 00:28:06,657 -->
00:28:08,934 I don't make the rules. He said to stay so I stayed. 375
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,699 Oh. Well, I'll say this: 376 00:28:10,723 -->
00:28:12,934 When you forsake feminism you go all in. 377 00:28:12,958 -->
00:28:14,135 You're almost Amish. 378 00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,999 I don't have
a choice, I'm fucking stuck here. 379 00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:18,734 Don't sell
me that bullshit, Summer. 380 00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:21,867 You were with him
last night at the country fair. 381 00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:23,533 With his
stormtroopers on either side of us. 382 00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:25,434 Well, you
didn't look like much of a captive 383 00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,699 sucking his
tongue down your throat. 384 00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:30,367 It's hard to play the
victim, Summer, whiles you're on top. 385 00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,999 Why does
it bother you so much that 386 00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,699 I see in him
exactly what you see? 387 00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:36,800 I have no desire to suck
my father's face. 388 00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:37,833 You know what I mean. 389
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,267 Where's your dad live, huh? 390 00:28:40,291 -->
00:28:42,999 I'll go fuck him. 391 00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:44,566 Don't touch my
Tito's. 392 00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,057 I drink Scotch. 393 00:28:46,159 -->
00:28:47,800 Course you do, with your hairy fucking armpits. 394 00:28:47,824
--> 00:28:50,267 Oh, and let's get one thing clear: 395 00:28:50,291 -->
00:28:52,600 You touch my peanut M in the freezer. 396 00:28:52,624 -->
00:28:54,135 I will kill you in your sleep. 397 00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,159 I
sleep with a knife. And I have a peanut allergy. 398 00:28:58,657 -->
00:29:01,533 You know, we might make it through this. 399 00:29:01,557 -->
00:29:02,534 If you're done insulting me 400 00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:03,959 I
have something I need to show you. 401 00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:06,523 Come here.
402 00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,600
<i>And it is for those people,</i>

403 00:29:12,624 --> 00:29:15,399
<i>and for the future of Montana,</i>

404 00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:17,699
<i>that the Attorney General's office, under Article 5,</i>

405 00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,833
<i>and section 13 of the State Constitution,</i>

406 00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:25,159
<i>is requesting a Senate Tribunal seeking impeachment.</i>

407 00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,466
<i>The assembly voted 67 to 33 in favor.</i>

408 00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,333
<i>Now, that subjects Governor John Dutton</i>

409 00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,499
<i>to the first impeachment tribunal</i>

410 00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:37,699
<i>in the state's history.</i>

411 00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:45,923 That motherfucker. 412 00:30:36,490 -->
00:30:39,168 So, branding's all over, huh? 413 00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:40,966 You
pulling out? 414 00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,999 My family pulled about an hour
ago. 415 00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:45,066 You were working and I didn't want to
interrupt, 416 00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,367 but I wanted to say goodbye, and...
417 00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:50,258 I don't know, maybe we could go and, I
dunno... 418 00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,466 If your family's gone how are you
gonna get home? 419 00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,200 I have my truck here. 420
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,234 - You can drive? - Of course. 421 00:30:58,258 -->
00:31:00,200 How old do you think I am? 422 00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,800
Wait... How old are you? 423 00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,168 No, I didn't mean,
like, 'can you drive' 424 00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,057 of course you can drive,
it's just... 425 00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,458 I don't have truck, just a dumb
cowboy. 426 00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,566 What time you done working? 427
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,333 You don't have school tomorrow? 428 00:31:13,357
--> 00:31:15,399 It's summer. Nobody has school tomorrow. 429 00:31:15,423 -->
00:31:16,800 Right. 430 00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,199 You're done with school?
431 00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:21,223 I mean, uh... it's more like school's done
with me. 432 00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,857 Well, I can wait for you, if you want
me to. 433 00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:30,758 I'd like that. 434 00:31:33,891 -->
00:31:35,734 That's a lot to unsaddle. 435 00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:36,568 You
want a hand? 436 00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:37,758 I ain't too proud to say no. 437
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:39,657 - Okay. - Come on. 438 00:31:42,523 -->
00:31:43,624 Grab that one. 439 00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,633 I got two pots of
coffee on. 440 00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,333 Grab your mugs and get 'em filled.
441 00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,633 It's not cold in Texas, is it? 442
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,057 You think it's cold here? 443 00:31:56,159 -->
00:31:59,266 You gonna freeze the fuzz of them little peaches down there. 444
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,199 Coldest I ever been is prowling heifers 445
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,600 on the Pitchfork in January. 446 00:32:02,624 -->
00:32:05,734 Pack everything you got. Your long Johns, your jackets. 447
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,135 There ain't no trees to break the wind where we're
going. 448 00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,135 And you won't call a twenty-mile-an
hour wind 449 00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,399 a wind after a winter down there,
guys. 450 00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,699 Better than here. They're damn near to
Mexico. 451 00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:15,667 It's colder than a mother-in-law's
heart 452 00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:16,601 down there, boys. 453 00:32:16,625 -->
00:32:18,300 I'm telling you. Just pack it. 454 00:32:18,324 --> 00:32:20,234
It's better it lives in the truck than not to have it at all. 455 00:32:20,258
--> 00:32:21,333 You gonna miss me? 456 00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,434 I don't
know how to answer that considering 457 00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,466 I was
forced into this relationship. 458 00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,399 If you love
something, Teeter, set it free. 459 00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:27,400 I mean fuck
that. 460 00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:28,766 He lucky I ain't chaining his ass 461
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,133 to the fucking radiator. 462 00:32:30,157 -->
00:32:31,300 I don't know if going back to Texas 463 00:32:31,324 -->
00:32:33,667 is gonna be the best thing for her speech therapy. 464 00:32:34,857
--> 00:32:36,667 There it is, a zinger from the cheap seats. 465 00:32:36,691
--> 00:32:38,167 Rip: Shit, Ethan, I've known you ten years, 466 00:32:38,191
--> 00:32:39,766 and you finally said something half-funny. 467 00:32:39,790 -->
00:32:40,833 That was pretty fucking funny. 468 00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:42,266
You get all them dresses packed? 469 00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,867 Don't start
that fucking shit. 470 00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,057 They all gonna fit in
there? 471 00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,367 Don't fucking start it. 472
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:48,151 He's got 'em in a hanging bag in the trailer. 473
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,266 All right, y'all, let's roll. 474 00:32:56,891 -->
00:32:58,600 Rip: Lloyd. 475 00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,300 I got it handled
here, brother. 476 00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:01,434 I know you do. 477 00:33:01,458
--> 00:33:01,967 You need anything, you let me know. 478 00:33:01,991 -->
00:33:03,357 You, too man. 479 00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:08,490 Adios, boys. 480
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:11,223 See you, guys. 481 00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,199
Ethan: Play a little hold em? 482 00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:16,266 Lloyd: Hell,
ain't got nothin' better to do. 483 00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,758 I'll fly out
and see you in a week. 484 00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:49,523 I love you. 485
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,523 - See you in Texas. - See you on Texas. 486
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,391 Teeter. 487 00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:23,958 I...
love... you. 488 00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:32,700 It was the perfect speech, it was
the perfect delivery. 489 00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:34,965 Everything about it was
perfect. 490 00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:37,157 And you got the votes. 491
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,858 He's gonna fight. 492 00:35:42,523 -->
00:35:43,989 I don't doubt it. 493 00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:56,233 Oh, shit. It's
my sister. 494 00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,166 Just ignore her. She'll go away.
495 00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,657 You don't know my sister. 496 00:36:01,891 -->
00:36:02,891 See? 497 00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:06,757 Shit. Jesus. 498
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:15,932 - Jamie? - There's a term for this, Beth. 499
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,800 It's called breaking and entering. 500
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:20,133 There's a term for the reason I'm doing it: 501
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:23,533 It's called career suicide, and you fucking just
did it. 502 00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,733 Get the fuck out of my house! Out of
my house! 503 00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:28,690 - Get out! - Fuck you, Jamie! 504
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,932 Tomorrow, you will call a press conference 505
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:39,267 and you will resign from office. 506 00:36:39,291
--> 00:36:41,233 Do you fucking understand me, Jamie? 507 00:36:41,257 -->
00:36:42,865 You will resign 508 00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,922 or I'm printing
photos for the sheriff. 509 00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,834 No, you're not. 510
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,733 Doubt me. Doubt me, Jamie. 511 00:36:53,757 -->
00:36:55,358 I am begging you. 512 00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,767 How many
<i>bodies</i>

513 00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,999 has your father put in the same spot? 514
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:09,932 Turn me in and you turn him in. 515 00:37:09,956
--> 00:37:11,657 Have you thought this through? 516 00:37:15,657 -->
00:37:17,898 Wait, did you even know? 517 00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:20,166 Did you
think I just picked a turnout 518 00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,599 on the Wyoming
border at fucking random?! 519 00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:26,056 There's a century's
worth of our family's secrets 520 00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,499 down at the
bottom of that canyon. 521 00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:31,267 You want to see how
fast they take the ranch from us then? 522 00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,633 It'll
straighten your fucking hair, that's how fast. 523 00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,056
Bullshit. 524 00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:38,233 Ask him. Ask your husband. Where the
train station is, 525 00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,367 and how many times he's been
there. 526 00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,557 You want to know the real price for
protecting the ranch? 527 00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:50,200 I don't think you do.
528 00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:53,798 If the goal is protecting the ranch from
future generations 529 00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:55,666 of which you have none, 530
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,166 then monetizing the ranch is the only option. 531
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,291 The airport was the only option and you fucking
know it! 532 00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:03,466 You're a business woman. 533
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,898 How's the cattle business treating you, Beth? 534
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:06,700 You see any long term plays there? 535
00:38:06,724 --> 00:38:09,133 You know all of this! 536 00:38:09,157 -->
00:38:10,889 And you can't convince him. 537 00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:16,267 Well,
I am guaranteeing the ranch is passed down to Tate, 538 00:38:16,291 -->
00:38:17,268 to my son. 539 00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:20,466 To their children some
day. 540 00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,166 That is the promise that I made, 541
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,499 and that is the promise I'm gonna keep. 542
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:28,999 The greatest threat to that ranch is our father.
543 00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,666 And you know that, too. 544 00:38:31,690 -->
00:38:35,133 So <i>I</i> will remove the threat. 545 00:38:42,423 -->
00:38:44,133 You'll take your approval anywhere 546 00:38:44,157 -->
00:38:46,023 you can find it, won't you, Jamie? 547 00:38:50,789 -->
00:38:52,922 I bet you are one expensive hooker. 548 00:38:54,889 -->
00:38:56,623 You enjoying your marionette? 549 00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:01,789
Every inch of him. 550 00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,157 Okay. So, it's war. 551
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:09,391 The War's over, Beth. 552 00:39:12,856 -->
00:39:14,590 No, Jamie. 553 00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,157 War is just beginning.
554 00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:47,865
<i>And this just in.</i>

555 00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,765
<i>Wolf Watch, the environmental group that funds</i>

556 00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,965
<i>the radio collar studies of wolf packs in the park</i>

557 00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,798
<i>has just issued a press release claiming that they</i>

558 00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:56,499

<i>from the Prospect Peak wolf pack,</i>

560 00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,133
<i>and they say that the data indicates</i>

561 00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,499
<i>that the wolves could have been killed</i>

562 00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:03,633
<i>on Governor John Dutton's Yellowstone Ranch,</i>

563 00:40:03,657 --> 00:40:05,099
<i>which borders the park.</i>

564 00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:08,566
<i>So far, no comment from the Governor's Office.</i>

565 00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,166 When it rains it pours, huh? 566 00:40:10,190
--> 00:40:12,066 They never reached out for comment. 567 00:40:12,090 -->
00:40:14,233 And nothing indicated they were killed on your ranch. 568
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:16,698 I mean, this is, this is... 569 00:40:16,722 -->
00:40:19,099 It's a hit piece, Clara. 570 00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:20,434 They
smell blood in the water. 571 00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,657 - Who smells blood?
- Everyone. 572 00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,503 Maybe you should take them to the
train station. 573 00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,566 The what? 574 00:40:36,590 -->
00:40:38,123 Could I have a moment with my daughter? 575 00:40:52,123 -->
00:40:53,599 Have a seat. 576 00:40:53,623 --> 00:40:54,956 No, I'll stand. 577
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,434 What do you want to know? 578 00:41:00,458 -->
00:41:01,698 What is it? 579 00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:04,965 Exactly. 580
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,989 It's the trash can for everyone who's attacked us.
581 00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:13,898 It lays in a jurisdictional dead zone 582
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:17,056 in a county with a population of exactly zero. 583
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,334 Hence, no jury of your peers, 584 00:41:19,358 -->
00:41:21,233 and no court for a change in venue. 585 00:41:21,257 -->
00:41:23,599 Why are you so surprised? 586 00:41:23,623 --> 00:41:26,133 Where
did you think the men who attacked you in your office 587 00:41:26,157 -->
00:41:28,133 and attacked our ranch went? 588 00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:30,399
You're shocked we found a way to circumvent 589 00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:32,999
the consequences of defending ourselves? 590 00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,399 I'm
shocked we need a way. 591 00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:36,999 But we do. We always
have. 592 00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:38,367 And unless we're willing to walk away
593 00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:39,765 from one hundred and twenty years 594
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,698 of our family bleeding into this ground, 595
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:44,399 we always will. 596 00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:45,956
Jamie knows about it. 597 00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,666 Yes. 598 00:41:50,690
--> 00:41:53,466 Okay, I'm going to repeat that, Dad. 599 00:41:53,490 -->
00:41:56,458 Jamie knows about it. 600 00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,133 I'm aware,
Beth. 601 00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:06,698 He will use everything that he knows to
destroy you. 602 00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:09,367 He has made it clear. 603
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:11,623 Yes, I believe he has. 604 00:42:38,324 -->
00:42:40,434 If there is a place our enemies go 605 00:42:40,458 -->
00:42:42,633 and nobody ever knows they went, Dad, 606 00:42:42,657 -->
00:42:44,657 and they will never come back... 607 00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:52,989
then I think that's the place for Jamie. 608 00:42:58,391 --> 00:42:59,722 What
do you think, Daddy? 609 00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:21,633 Ow. 610 00:43:21,657 -->
00:43:22,698 Sorry. 611 00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,133 I bet. 612 00:43:25,157
--> 00:43:27,832 She's a real piece of work, your sister. 613 00:43:27,856 -->
00:43:30,200 Oh, yeah. 614 00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,690 She's a monster. 615
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:36,690 She always has been. 616 00:43:39,157 -->
00:43:41,765 She used to stab me under the dinner table with a fork. 617
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,056 Mm-hm. 618 00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:45,224 No
reason, just for the fun of it. 619 00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,556 Actually,
she's done it as an adult. 620 00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:53,757 I would hardly
refer to your sister as an adult. 621 00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,423 What do you
think she'll do next? 622 00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,399 The truth? 623
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:06,324 Yeah. 624 00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:12,334 I'll think
she'll try to have me killed. 625 00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:16,423 Come on... 626
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,722 You really think so? 627 00:44:24,690 -->
00:44:25,690 Yes. 628 00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:34,200 Do you... do you know
anyone... 629 00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:36,267 or, um... 630 00:44:36,291 -->
00:44:38,798 is there a group 631 00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:41,657 that has
experience with this kind of situation? 632 00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:48,765 You
assign yourself security, Jamie. 633 00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,889 That's
playing defense. 634 00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,523 What if I want to play... 635
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:00,889 offense? 636 00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:11,789 There
are companies, yeah. 637 00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:19,932 There's one in New York,
and there's one in Virginia. 638 00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,590 How are they? 639
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,432 They're professionals. 640 00:45:27,456 -->
00:45:29,056 They're not hit men. 641 00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:34,365 It will look
like a... 642 00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:37,623 heart attack or a car accident. 643
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:45,133 Perhaps I could meet with them, 644 00:45:45,157
--> 00:45:47,666 and see how they would handle this. 645 00:45:47,690 -->
00:45:49,733 Jamie, you don't want to do that. 646 00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:53,832
You tell me what you want, 647 00:45:53,856 --> 00:45:58,465 and I will meet
with them. 648 00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,898 See, if you're going to go after
her, you just might... 649 00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:05,633 Maybe... 650
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:07,566 You know. 651 00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,590 Yeah,
that's what I was thinking, too. 652 00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:28,889 Hey, hey,
hey. 653 00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,532 What's so funny? 654 00:46:39,556 -->
00:46:41,265 What? 655 00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,023 You're smiling like the cat
that ate the canary. 656 00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:48,056 Oh. Didn't know I was.
657 00:46:48,157 --> 00:46:50,200 You got a big, old shit-eating grin on your
face 658 00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,757 like you spent the night in some girl's
arms. 659 00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:55,432 - I do? - Yeah. 660 00:46:55,456 -->
00:46:57,765 They starting younger and younger. 661 00:46:57,789 -->
00:46:59,666 Okay. 662 00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:33,690 - Morning. - Morning. 663
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,922 Just a couple more trucks and we can go home. 664
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:41,265 Can we stop by the East Camp on the way home? 665
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:43,365 How do you know about East Camp? 666 00:47:43,389
--> 00:47:44,898 Your father told me. 667 00:47:44,922 --> 00:47:47,265 Said it
was ours if we wanted. 668 00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:49,432 If you'd help out while
the cowboys are gone 669 00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:50,489 and he's in Helena. 670
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:53,965 Is that what you want? 671 00:47:53,989 -->
00:47:56,265 Here's what I don't want. 672 00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:58,532 I don't
want to go back to a rented house 673 00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:02,233 and stare at
a nursery that isn't filled. 674 00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:03,757 And I don't want
to take it down. 675 00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:07,265 I'd rather move it. 676
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,523 Start over and try again, you know? 677
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:12,590 Be nice to have something of our own. 678
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:14,898 Yeah. 679 00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:16,999 We'd be
living under this again. 680 00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:20,832 Well, I live under it
anyway. 681 00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,289 East Camp is not much of a house,
baby. 682 00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:25,556 Yeah, but it would be ours. 683
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:34,822 In my vision, the choice that I saw, 684
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:37,690 was between this place and you. 685 00:48:41,322
--> 00:48:42,856 Was East Camp in your vision? 686 00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,989
Well, maybe this is the way we have both. 687 00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:56,257
Okay, we'll take a look at it then. 688 00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,690 Kayce,
bring up another load. undefined
